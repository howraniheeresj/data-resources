### Meetings
Data Liaisons Meeting - Data people from departments across the city get together, get assistance in the Open Data process, hear what each other are working on, and share successes and challenges. On the second Tuesday of each month, someone from a different department shares a data project they are working on. Contact Joel Howrani Heeres (howraniheeresj@detroitmi.gov) for more information or for an invitation.
